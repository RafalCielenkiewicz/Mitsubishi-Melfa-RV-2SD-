# Mitsubishi Melfa RV-2SD Robotic Disk Sorting System

## Project Overview

This project involved the development and implementation of an automated disk sorting system utilizing a Mitsubishi Melfa RV-2SD robotic manipulator. The system was designed to autonomously retrieve, analyze and segregate disks based on their appearance. This was achieved through the integration of various external devices, including sensors, controllers, solenoid valves, and a Siemens S7-1200 PLC.

## Key Features

* **Automated Disk Handling:** The Mitsubishi Melfa RV-2SD robot was programmed to precisely retrieve and manipulate disks.
* **Appearance-Based Segregation:** Disks were sorted based on the presence and location of holes (center or side) using sensor and laser data.
* **PLC Integration:** A Siemens S7-1200 PLC was used to manage the interaction between the robot and external devices, programmed in TIA Portal.
* **Dual Ramp Sorting:** Segregated disks were directed into two separate ramps for counting and collection.
* **Real-Time Data Processing:** Sensors and lasers provided real-time data to the PLC, enabling accurate and timely sorting decisions.

## Technologies Used

* **Robotic Manipulator:** Mitsubishi Melfa RV-2SD
* **PLC:** Siemens S7-1200
* **Programming Environment:** TIA Portal


## Results

The system successfully automated the disk sorting process, demonstrating accurate segregation based on appearance. Integration of the Mitsubishi Melfa RV-2SD robot with the Siemens S7-1200 PLC and external devices went smoothly, ensuring efficient and reliable operation.

Below is a photo, and a short video demonstration of the robot in action is available in repository.
