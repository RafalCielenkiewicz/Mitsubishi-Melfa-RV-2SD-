Working with the robot involved programming the manipulator and
integration with external devices such as sensors,
controllers, solenoid valves and a Siemens S7-1200 PLC.The exact
interaction between these components and the robot was
programmed in TIA Portal, which enabled the correct
retrieval of the disks and their segregation based on appearance, thanks to the
sensors and a laser. The pucks were segregated into two ramps, where they
they were counted. One contained those with holes from the center or from the
side, and in the other were those without.
